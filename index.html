<p> Jaden Smith is the son of Will Smith, both who are successful actors. Jaden Smith was born in Malibu California, and is now 19 years old. What is so interesting about Jaden is that he went from staring in films, to making music. Jaden released an album called SYRE which has a song called Icon, which now has over 100 million streams.</p>

 <h3> Why is Jaden Smith so interesting? </h3>
 <p> although Jaden is known for films such as karate kid, pursuit of happiness, and after earth, Jaden actually has been rapping for a while now and is very good at it in my opinion. I feel as though he makes music that makes much better sense compared to the other new age rappers. so give his music a chance, trust me you won't be disappointed.</p>
